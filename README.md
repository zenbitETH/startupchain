# StartupChain

StartupChain helps founders claim an ENS-backed company identity and manage it from one onchain dashboard. Visit the app at [startupchain.io](https://startupchain.io).

## What you can do
- Register your company’s ENS name and see ownership details in one place.
- Connect with Privy or your wallet to stay verified across the flow.
- Track your company record from the dashboard without juggling multiple tools.

## How it works
1. Connect or create your wallet (Privy is built in if you’re new to crypto).
2. Search for the ENS name you want and start the registration flow.
3. Confirm the transaction, then view your company details on the dashboard.

## What you’ll need
- An Ethereum wallet or a Privy login.
- A small amount of ETH for gas during registration.
