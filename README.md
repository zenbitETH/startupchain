# StartupChain

StartupChain is an OSS dApp for Onchain Company Services, built so founders can launch and run their company identity from one place. [startupchain.io](https://startupchain.io).
`Status: early production.`

## What’s inside

- 🪪 ENS company name & subdomains
- 🏦 Multichain Safe setup for treasury
- 🧾 EAS attestations to prove activity
- 💸 DeFi rails for basic treasury moves
- 🪙 Company token as an internal economy

## Why founders use it

- Claim an ENS-backed company identity fast.
- Keep ownership, treasury, and attestations together.
- Stay verified with Privy or your wallet—no extra dashboards.

## How it works

1) Connect or create a wallet (Privy is built in if you're new).
2) Search for your company's ENS name and configure your company (founders, equity).
3) Send a one-time payment to StartupChain treasury.
4) StartupChain handles all the blockchain transactions automatically:
   - ENS commitment & registration
   - Safe wallet deployment
   - Company recording on-chain
5) Manage everything from your dashboard.

## What you need

- An Ethereum wallet or a Privy login.
- ETH to cover: ENS registration + Safe deployment + 25% service fee.
