# StartupChain

StartupChain is an OSS dApp for Onchain Company Services, built so founders can launch and run their company identity from one place. [startupchain.io](https://startupchain.io).
`Status: early production.`

## What’s inside

- 🪪 ENS company name & subdomains
- 🏦 Multichain Safe setup for treasury
- 🧾 EAS attestations to prove activity
- 💸 DeFi rails for basic treasury moves
- 🪙 Company token as an internal economy

## Why founders use it

- Keep ownership, treasury, and attestations together.
- Stay verified with Privy or your wallet—no extra dashboards.

## How it works

2) Search for your company’s ENS name and start registration.
3) Confirm the transaction, then manage everything from the dashboard.
